### pe03-todolist
This is a simple ToDo List application built using React. The app allows users to add or delete the task as needed.The application shows how to utilize React's useState hook for dynamic component rendering and state management.

### Input
- User enter a description of the task in the input field.
- Users just need to click the "Add Task" button after entering the task description in the input field.
- To remove a task, users can click the "Delete" button next to the specific task they want to delete.

### Process 
1. The app manages the tasks list using React's useState hook. The state is updated whenever a new task is added or an existing task is deleted.
2.  Event handlers are implemented to capture user interactions:
      - Clicking the "Add Task" button adds a task to the list. 
      - By using the "Delete" button, that specific task is removed from the list.
3.  The list of tasks is rendered dynamically using the.map() function. Each task is displayed as a list item with a "Delete" button.

### Output 
- The app displays a list of tasks entered as users add or remove tasks.
- When a state changes, the UserInterface automatically update.
